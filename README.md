# Project Name: After-Effects-of-Covid-on-Economy

# DataSet:
Kaggal: https://www.kaggle.com/darknez/gdp-among-world?select=GDPfinal.json

# Project Description: 
Inspired from the nationwide economic trends with the area and analyze the right relations and trends.
The Dataset has the GDP and other effecting factors for the countries in 2020 as per covid 19, this can be use to analyze the economic trends of each country.
This contains the different descriptive columns in the dataset.The content is just for 184 countries in total. 
I am planning to get some more information over the internet.

# DataSet Exploration and visualisation:
* Using pandas to analyse any specific trends and insights from the dataset.
* using MongoDB to save the data for future use.
* using HTML/CSS and D3/plotly to add visulations of trends and relations.
* using leaflet to display interactive visulaization of multiplt e factors in 184 countries. (Since Dataset does not have lat and lng data of each conutry, Need to figure some other data source for that and merge two JSON togather.)

# Considerations:
* checking out mutiple js libraries for visulaisation.
* leaflet plugin explorations for interative maps.
